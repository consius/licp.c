# licp.c
Insights on programming I gained while learning Lisp were already great enough. Now I think its the time to take this on a next level by writing a Lisp interpreter in C.

## But why C?
It have to do with the purpose of writing this project. I am writing it for educational and recreational purposes. And I believe it would be better for me if more of the things are done explicity by me instead of being handled under the hood by the programming language and C provides me with just that.

## Quick Start
```console
$ gcc licp.c -o licp
$ ./licp
```
